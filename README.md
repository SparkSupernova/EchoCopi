# 🧠 EchoCopi™ Core (Free Edition)

**The Local Memory Engine for AI Coding Assistants.**

EchoCopi Core is a lightweight Python library that gives your AI (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf) a **persistent memory**.

Unlike static `.cursorrules` files or text prompts, EchoCopi is a **living ledger**. It allows your AI to log thoughts, architectural decisions, and project milestones to a local JSON database that persists across sessions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install
Copy the `src/echo_memory.py` file into your project. We recommend placing it in a hidden folder like `.echo/` or `tools/`.

```bash
mkdir .echo
cp src/echo_memory.py .echo/
```

### 2. Initialize
In any Python script (or even a temporary script you ask the AI to run), import and initialize the engine.

```python
from .echo.echo_memory import echo

# Initialize the memory engine
e = echo()
```

### 3. Log a Memory
Tell the AI to log a thought. It will save to your AI's memory file.

```python
# Log a milestone
e.log_thought(
    category="milestone",
    thought="We just decided to use FastAPI instead of Flask.",
    context={"reason": "Async support", "performance": "high"}
)
```

## 📂 How It Works

When you run the code above, EchoCopi creates a `.echo_memory/` folder in your project root.

```text
.echo_memory/
├── evolution.json       # The master ledger of all memories
└── echo_state/          # Snapshots of the AI's mental state
```

*   **Local & Private:** Data never leaves your machine.
*   **Verifiable:** Every entry is hashed (SHA-256) to prevent corruption.
*   **Universal:** Works with any AI that can run a Python script.
